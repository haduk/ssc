Define Requirements:

Deploy an app server (using EC2 instances).
Integrate the app server with a load balancer (using ALB).
Set up a managed database (using RDS).
Ensure the infrastructure can handle external traffic efficiently.
Maintain flexibility and reusability in the Terraform script.

Structure the Terraform Configuration:

Use modules to encapsulate different parts of the infrastructure (e.g., VPC, EC2, ALB, RDS).
Define variables for flexibility.
Output important information for easy access and debugging.

Plan the Network Configuration:

Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
Ensure the load balancer is accessible from the internet.
Place the app servers in public subnets and the database in private subnets.

Set Up the EC2 Instances:

Use a minimal AMI (Amazon Linux 2).
Automate the installation of necessary software (e.g., Nginx).
Ensure security by setting up security groups.

Configure the Load Balancer:

Use an Application Load Balancer for better traffic management.
Set up target groups and listeners.
Attach EC2 instances to the target group.

Set Up the RDS Instance:

Use a MySQL database with appropriate configurations.
Ensure the database is in a private subnet.
Set up security groups to restrict access.

Steps
Initialize the Project:

Create a new directory for the Terraform configuration.
Set up the necessary Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, etc.).

Define Variables:

Define variables for flexibility in variables.tf.

Set Up the Network Module:

Create a network module to handle the VPC, subnets, and security groups.

Set Up the EC2 Instances:

Create a module or resource configuration for the EC2 instances.
Configure the instances to run Nginx and ensure they are placed in the public subnets.

Configure the Load Balancer:

Create a module or resource configuration for the ALB.
Set up the target group and listener to route traffic to the EC2 instances.

Set Up the RDS Instance:

Create a module or resource configuration for the RDS instance.
Ensure the RDS instance is placed in private subnets and properly secured.

Output Important Information:

Define outputs to easily access important information such as the ALB DNS name and RDS endpoint.
Apply the Configuration:

Initialize Terraform.
Plan and apply the configuration.
